	<p><strong>Instructions for Authors</strong> </p>
	
	<p>All submissions should use the Springer LNCS format. The final camera-ready version must be at most 20 pages (with at most 4 more pages with charging )
	excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Details on the Springer LNCS format can be obtained 
	<a href="https://www.springer.com/cn/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">here</a>. 
	Authors should not change the font or the margins of the LNCS format. 
	There is no page limit on the appendices and supplementary material. 
	Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. 
	It is strongly encouraged that submissions are processed in LaTeX. All submissions must have page numbers.</p>
	
	<p>All submissions must have page numbers. All submissions will be blind-refereed and thus must be anonymous, 
	with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.
	Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF format. 
	Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere 
	or has submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. 
	Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.
	Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.</p>
