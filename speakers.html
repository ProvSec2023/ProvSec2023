					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Toward Data Security on AI Systems</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>AI has unlocked incredible potential to analyze, interpret, and act on the increasingly vast amounts of data. With the swift rise of AI adoption in corporate and government settings, data security and privacy are top concerns.
 
This talk will give an introduction to data security on AI systems, especially from the perspective of the threats and attack surfaces in the data-driven lifecycle for machine learning systems. The threats are widespread at all stages of AI systems, boosting the research on various types of attacks and security/privacy-enhancing technologies with different focuses on the training, Inference and deployment phases. I will also discuss our recent advances and future opportunities in these researches.</p>

					<h3>Yu Jiang</h3>
					<strong>Biography:</strong>
					<p>Yu Jiang Ph.D., Associate Professor of Tsinghua University, School of Software. He received his PhD. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University in 2015, worked as a Postdoc in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016. His research focuses on safety and security assurance of software systems. The work is published in flagship conferences such as SOSP, PLDI, ATC, and S&P . The implemented framework improves the coverage of existing widely used fuzzers (e.g. AFL and libFuzzer) by 50%-200% and has detected 500+ previous-unknown vulnerabilities, 200+ of which were included in the US national vulnerability database and assigned unique CVE numbers. It has been integrated into Google  ClusterFuzz, Microsoft OneFuzz,  AFL++ to perform security testing on their products.  He has won the China Computer Association outstanding doctoral dissertation award 2015, Young Rising Star of Microsoft Research Asia 2018, Damo Academy Young Fellow 2020, and Webank Scholar 2021.</P>
					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Cross-layer Fuzzing of Blockchain System</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>Fuzzing is a promising method for discovering vulnerabilities. Recently, various techniques are developed to improve the efficiency of fuzzing, and impressive gains are observed in evaluation results. In this talk, we present an empirical evaluation of fuzzing techniques and its customization on BlockChain systems. First, we systematically introduce and evaluate typical fuzzers on a unified test suite. Then, we demonstrate how to customize it to the different layers of blockchain systems, including smart contracts, virtual machine, and consensus protocols.</p>
