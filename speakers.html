					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Recent Developments in Post-Quantum Cryptography</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>The security of current public-key cryptosystems relies on the hardness 
of factoring large integers or solving discrete logarithm problems. 
However, these computational problems can be solved in polynomial time 
using a quantum computer. This vulnerability has prompted research into 
post-quantum cryptography using alternative mathematical problems that 
are secure in the era of quantum computers.
In this talk, we give an overview of recent developments in post-quantum 
cryptography. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) began the standardization project of post-quantum cryptography. 
In 2022, NIST has selected CRYSTALS-Kyber for public-key encryption and 
key-establishment, and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+ for digital 
signature algorithms. Very recently, NIST has started the standardization 
of additional digital signature schemes, and there were 40 submission schemes 
in the first round. In this talk, we also explain the QR-UOV scheme, which 
is an efficient variant of the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar signature (UOV) 
based on the hardness of solving the multivariate quadratic (MQ) problem.</p>

					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Pragmatic Cryptography for Cloud Computing Security</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>The emergence of cloud has significantly reduces the costs of hardware and software resources in computing infrastructure and the data is usually encrypted before outsourcing to the cloud.
This talk will focus on the effort to secure cloud storage, which is an important aspect of cloud computing adoption. We will discuss the theory and practice of secure cloud computing. Particularly, we will focus on the research problems in this area and some possible solutions.
We will close the talk with future directions in this area.</p>

					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Toward Data Security on AI Systems</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>AI has unlocked incredible potential to analyze, interpret, and act on the increasingly vast amounts of data. With the swift rise of AI adoption in corporate and government settings, data security and privacy are top concerns.
 
This talk will give an introduction to data security on AI systems, especially from the perspective of the threats and attack surfaces in the data-driven lifecycle for machine learning systems. The threats are widespread at all stages of AI systems, boosting the research on various types of attacks and security/privacy-enhancing technologies with different focuses on the training, Inference and deployment phases. I will also discuss our recent advances and future opportunities in these researches.</p>

					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Searchable Symmetric Encryption and its attacks </p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is a technique that allows users to delegate keyword searches over encrypted databases to a server that may be honest but curious, while preserving the privacy of the keywords and the encrypted documents. In this presentation, we will begin by introducing the concepts, mechanisms, and security notions related to SSE. We will then discuss current attacks on SSE and highlight some of the open problems in this area. </p>
